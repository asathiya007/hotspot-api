HotSpot is an artificial intelligence tool that uses computer vision to detect wildfires in aerial images captured by planes, drones, satellites, etc. This project was inspired by California's wildfire crisis in August 2020. Check out the completed product here: https://hotspot-asathiya.herokuapp.com/

The repo containing the code for the the PyTorch neural network used for detecting wildfires from aerial images (from drones, planes, satellites, etc.) and the Flask API that exposes this network can be found here: https://github.com/asathiya007/hotspot-api

The repo containing the React user interface code can be found here: https://github.com/asathiya007/hotspot
